# LabTech--Script-Backup
This script will backup each LabTech script as an xml file. The script will also create the same folder structure as in LT. These exports will not include files from the transfer directory or any other scripts that are called.
The last date and user modified will be appended to the script so that it can be used as version control.

The MySQL .NET connector is required.
